  <h3>I am super excited. Never would I have thought that me, Alexis Adams, would construct a website! I mean this is absolutely mind blowing!</h3>
  <h5>My past careers have consisted of...
      <ol>
        <li>Very first job... Bojangles</li>
        <li>Cookout running in second</li>
        <li>From a cashier to a bank teller at Wells Fargo</li>
        <li>CONSTRUCTION, actually learned to drive machinery</li>
        <li>Now currently, Amazon...</li>
      </ol>
      And while at Amazon I decided to push myself a little further and use the career choice program to enroll in software development!

  <h1>The Right Now..</h1>
  <h3>How is Everything Going? Do I feel I made a just decision?</h3>
  <h5> Software development is a CHALLENGE! Some days I want to go on my balcony and scream!!! Other days, I'm like this is a breeze.
    <ul>
      <li>HTML, I love! I like the structure of it. The first part of construction in my head.</li>
      <li>Javascript, I have mixed feelings about. Some days I get it, other days its like French. And by the way, I don't speak French.</li>
      <li>All hail CSS!!! It is the one thing that literally beats me up and spits me out like a piece of gum.</li>
    </ul>

  <h1>The Future...

  <h3>I plan on starting out working for a company to develop my skills and work on bringing some of their visions to life. Then I plan on possibly opening my own business where I plan to do logos and build webistes for companies or anyone who enlists my help. This is something I am super excited about because never would I have ever saw myself here. A builder!!</h3>
